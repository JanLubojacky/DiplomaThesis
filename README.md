## TODOs
- [ ] preprocessor for splitting data into cross validation splits
- [ ] base class for evaluating an experiment
- [ ] visualizer for creating output plots from the output table

# Notes
- A good point for discussion might be that when not enough samples is available it might be better to use a simpler model than a neural network
- Could make an open source tool for processing gtfs
- What kinds of gene lengths should be used for normalizing
